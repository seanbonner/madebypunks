# Made by Punks

A trustless, community-owned directory of projects built by CryptoPunks holders.

## Philosophy

CryptoPunks belong to no one and everyone. This directory exists to celebrate the builders who keep the punk spirit alive.

**Made by Punks is not a company.** There is no team, no token, no roadmap. It's a public good maintained by the community, for the community.

- **Trustless** - All data lives in markdown files. No database, no backend, no single point of failure.
- **Permissionless** - Anyone can add their punk profile and projects via pull request.
- **Decentralized** - Fork it, remix it, make it your own. The code is MIT licensed.
- **Community-owned** - Maintainers are punk holders who volunteer their time.

This is lore that belongs to everyone.

## How It Works

1. All punk and project data is stored as **markdown files** in `content/punks/` and `content/projects/`
2. At build time, `src/data/punks.ts` reads all markdown files and parses the YAML frontmatter
3. Pages are statically generated for each punk and project
4. No database, no API, no runtime data fetching
