PunkCam lets you become a CryptoPunk. Upload a photo or use your camera, and the app automatically detects faces and overlays pixel-perfect punk faces on top.

## Features

- **Photo mode** - Upload or snap a photo. AI detects all faces and adds punks automatically.
- **Video mode** - Real-time face tracking with punk masks. Record videos as your favorite punk.
- **Full editor** - Move, resize, rotate, and layer multiple punks on a single image.
- **All 10,000 punks** - Browse and pick any CryptoPunk from the full collection.
- **Gallery** - Save your creations locally and revisit them anytime.
- **Share** - Export high-quality images and videos to share on social media.

Built with MediaPipe for face detection, Fabric.js for the editor, and the Kira engine for real-time video effects.
