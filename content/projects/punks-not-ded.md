Punks: Not Ded is Sean Bonner's unofficial companion to CryptoPunks: Free to Claim. Because CryptoPunks is a living thing - changing day to day with new stories and revised history—this addendum captures what couldn't make the cut-off date for the main book.

## What's Inside

- **Updated Blog Posts** - Expanded articles and essays
- **Recent News** - Events that happened after the main book went to print
- **Additional Stats** - Details useful only to the nerdiest of collectors
- **Unpacked Thoughts** - Further reflections on the punk ecosystem

## Limited Editions

- **Hardcover** - Limited to 88 signed and numbered copies
- **Burn to Redeem** - Special edition using a token redemption system
- **Personalized** - Each copy features one of the CryptoPunks traits

As Bonner says: "This is not for everybody, but it's definitely for some people."
