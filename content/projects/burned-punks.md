Burned Punks is an art project and memorial by Sean Bonner that documents the CryptoPunks that have been sent to null addresses, permanently removing them from circulation.

## From Ashes to Ether

When a punk is "burned" (sent to a null address), it's gone forever. This project tracks and memorializes these lost punks, exploring themes of digital permanence, destruction, and value.
