Two Bit Punks is a generative art collection of 512 pieces by Sean Bonner - an exercise in assumptions, association, aggressive minimalism, and forced constraint.

## The Concept

While CryptoPunks defined the 24×24 pixelated portrait genre, Two Bit Punks walks a delicate line: drawing inspiration from them while simultaneously stripping away everything that makes them what they are.

## Inspirations

- **James Cagney** - The term "two-bit punk" evokes the 1938 film *Angels With Dirty Faces*
- **Mark Rothko** - The exploration of color and minimalism
- **Joe Strummer** - The punk ethos of The Clash
- **CryptoPunks** - The original 24×24 pixel portraits

## Part of a Larger Body of Work

Bonner has also created "Robopunks 2048," described as "a love letter to punks and robots," continuing his exploration of the punk aesthetic in generative art.
