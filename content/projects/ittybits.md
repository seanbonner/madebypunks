IttyBits is a 10k PFP project where each CryptoPunk is rendered at 12×12 pixels while retaining their original ID numbers and traits. Created by Jeremy.eth (posvar), it represents six months of work exploring how small a punk can be made while preserving its individuality.

## Technical Details

- **Fully On-chain** - All image data stored directly on Ethereum
- **12×12 Pixels** - The minimum size that preserves punk identity
- **SHA256 Authentication** - Hash-matching IDs verify authenticity
- **All Traits Included** - Every attribute from the original punks is represented

## Why 12×12?

When doing anything on-chain, minimizing data size is critical. The question was: how small can a punk be made while retaining the individuality of the image? The answer turns out to be 12×12 pixels—any smaller and the traits become indistinguishable.
