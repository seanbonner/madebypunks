Punks Wrapper provides an easy-to-use and safe interface for the WrappedPunks smart contract. It allows CryptoPunk owners to wrap their punks into ERC-721 tokens, enabling compatibility with modern NFT marketplaces and DeFi protocols.

## Why Wrap?

CryptoPunks predate the ERC-721 standard—they use a custom contract from 2017. Wrapping converts your punk to the standard NFT format, allowing you to:

- **Trade on OpenSea** and other ERC-721 marketplaces
- **Use in DeFi** protocols that require ERC-721
- **Bridge to Layer 2s** that support standard NFTs
- **Unwrap anytime** to get your original punk back

## Features

- **Simple UI** - Connect wallet and wrap in a few clicks
- **Safe & Audited** - Uses the official WrappedPunks contract
- **Full Reversibility** - Unwrap to restore your original punk
