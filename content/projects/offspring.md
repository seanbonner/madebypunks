/offspring is a RAW PIXEL MERGING MACHINE. NO TRAITS. JUST PURE PIXEL DNA COMBINATION. We take two CryptoPunks and SMASH their visual code together at the atomic level. Generating new an unique offspring at the pixel level. 

## Features

- **Generative Punk Offspring** - Generate unique offspring at the pixel level.  E
- **Final Offspring Simulation** - Starting with 10,000 unique punks, each generation combines traits from parent punks to create new offspring. The DNA mixing process gradually reduces the population while preserving and combining the pixels of each generation before to create a new offspring.


Part of the JunkDrawer suite of CryptoPunks tools by Pat Doyle, alongside PunkVerse.
