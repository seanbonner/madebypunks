## Two Ways to Add Your Work

### Option 1: Fill Out a Form (Easy)

Not comfortable with GitHub? No problem. Fill out [this form](https://github.com/madebypunks/directory/issues/new?template=project-submission.md&title=New+Project:+[Your+Project+Name]) and we'll add your work for you.

Just tell us:
- Your punk ID
- Name of your work
- What it is (a sentence or two)
- Website or link
- Any other links (socials, etc.)
- A thumbnail image (optional)

A maintainer will take it from there.

### Option 2: Submit via GitHub (For Those Who Know Git)

If you're comfortable with GitHub, you can add your work directly:

1. **Fork** the [repository](https://github.com/madebypunks/directory)
2. **Create** a file in `content/projects/your-project.md`
3. **Add** your info (see format below)
4. **Submit** a pull request

That's it. No gatekeepers, no approvals process. Just git.

## The Spirit of This Place

CryptoPunks belong to no one and everyone. This directory is the same.

- **No database** - Everything lives in simple text files
- **No backend** - Just static files, forkable and remix-friendly
- **No gatekeepers** - Anyone can contribute, anyone can fork
- **Community-maintained** - Volunteers who hold punks, nothing more

This is lore that belongs to everyone. Take it and build.
